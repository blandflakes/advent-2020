# Day 1
## Part 1

This could be done by loading everything into memory and doing some nested loops. Seems like it would be faster, though, to do it in one pass - shove everything into a Set. As we go down the line, we know what the other number is, because we subtract it from 2020. So we can check as we read, and if we find the other number in the set, we're done. This isn't necessarily an asymptotic improvement, since in the worst case we still put every element in memory.

## Part 2.

Well damnit. I don't think the Set trick actually works for three numbers - I think the solution basically requires me to nest at least one loop, and requires me to have the numbers in-memory (or to iterate the file several times). So much for elegance. Maybe I can get a very readable for-comprehension on this, once it's all in memory, though. This would actually be a nice time to whip out a kanren implementation.
